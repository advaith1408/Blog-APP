# Blog APP (MERN Stack)  

This is a full-stack blog platform built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). The application features role-based access control, real-time content updates, and optimized performance. It includes separate permissions for admins, authors, and readers, ensuring a structured and secure system. The platform integrates global state management using Redux or Context API to handle data efficiently. Real-time updates allow new posts and edits to reflect instantly without requiring a page refresh. The application has been optimized using lazy loading, caching, and database indexing, improving loading speed significantly. It has a responsive design built with Bootstrap to provide a seamless user experience across different devices. Secure authentication is implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to prevent unauthorized access. The frontend is deployed on platforms like Vercel or Netlify, while the backend runs on Render, Heroku, or AWS.
